                <p>William Shakespeare was an English poet, actor, and playwright, and is widely 
                    regarded as the greatest writer in the world. No birth record exists of William 
                    Shakespeare, but an old church record exists that says that he was baptised in April, 
                    1564, at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon. He is called the “Bard of Avon” and 
                    is often referred to as England’s National Poet. William Shakespeare is considered to 
                    be the greatest dramatist of all time.</p>
                <p>Throughout his career, he worked on 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems. 
                    His plays are very famous and have been translated into every language present on this planet,
                     and are considered to be the most performed plays of any other playwright. William Shakespeare
                      passed away on April 23, 1616, in Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

            <p>William Shakespeare was the greatest English poet, actor, and playwright of the Renaissance era. He was
                baptised on 26 April, 1564, at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon. From 1594 onwards, he was a
                very important member of the King’s Men company of theatrical players. For more than 450 years, Shakespeare’s 
                writing is celebrated throughout the world as his writing captures human emotions perfectly. In spite of being 
                known all around the world, William Shakespeare’s life has been a mystery.</p>
            <p>The outline of his life has been provided through his work on various poems, sonnets, plays, and others.
               Other sources that provide information about his life are official documentations, such as church and court 
               records. However, seven years of his life have not been recorded as his work and the documents at the church 
               only provide a brief sketch of specific events in his life and yield little insight into the man himself.</p>

                <p>In Shakespeare's era (1564-1616), it was not profitable but very fashionable to write poetry. It also provided credibility to his talent as a writer and helped to enhance his social standing. It seems writing poetry was something he greatly enjoyed and did mainly for himself at times when he was not consumed with writing a play. Because of their more private nature, few poems, particularly long-form poems, have been published.</p>
                <p>The two longest works that scholars agree were written by Shakespeare are entitled Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. Both dedicated to the Honorable Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, who seems to have acted as a sponsor and encouraging benefactor of Shakespeare's work for a brief time.</p>
                <p>Both of these poems contain dozens of stanzas and comment on the depravity of unwanted sexual advances, showing themes throughout of guilt, lust, and moral confusion. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis must reject the sexual advances of Venus. Conversely in The Rape of Lucrece, the honorable and virtuous wife Lucrece is raped a character overcome with lust, Tarquin. The dedication to Wriothesley is much warmer in the second poem, suggesting a deepening of their relationship and Shakespeare's appreciation of his support.</p>
                <p>A third and shorter narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, was printed in the first collection of Shakespeare's sonnets. Most scholars agree now that it was also written by Shakespeare, though that was contested for some time. The poem tells the story of a young woman who is driven to misery by a persuasive suitor's attempts to seduce her. It is not regarded by critics to be his finest work.</p>

            <P>Shakespeare's plays portray recognisable people in situations that we can all relate to - including love, marriage, death, mourning, guilt, the need to make difficult choices, separation, reunion and reconciliation. They do so with great humanity, tolerance, and wisdom. They help us to understand what it is to be human, and to cope with the problems of being so.  </P>
            <p>Working as a popular playwright, Shakespeare was also instrumental in fusing the materials of native and classical drama in his work. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, with its revenge theme, its ghost, and its bombastic set speeches, appears to be a tragedy based on the style of the Roman playwright Seneca, who lived in the first century c.e. </p>

                <P>On November 28, 1582, Shakespeare married Anne Hathway in Worcester, in Canterbury Province. Shakespeare was 18 and Anne Hathway was 26 when they married each other, and they had three children. Their first daughter, Susanna, was born on May 26, 1583. Two years later, they were blessed with twin daughters, named Hamnet and Judith.</P>
                <p>There are no records of Shakspeare’s life from the year 1582 to 1592. These years are called the “Lost Years''. From 1592, he got involved in writing and acting in the London theatre. Later in 1593, he published two poems, “Venus and Adonis’’ and ‘’The rape of Lucrece’’, which made him a household name. He wrote a lot of plays and they were performed by many around the world. The fortune he earned and the popularity he had let him build the Globe Theatre.</p>

        <p>Many plays of Shakespeare were published in editions of diversifying the accuracy and quality of his lifetime. Two actors and friends of Shakespeare in 1623, Henry Condell and John Heminges published the First Folio, which is a more conclusive text, a collected edition of the dramatic works of Shakespeare’s that consists of all his plays, except two. A poem by Ben Jonson was its preface that praised Shakespeare with the famous tag that meant his work wasn’t for any age span but for the whole time of lif</p>
        <p>William Shakespeare’s life has been a mystery to many, but his plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied and performed all around the world.</p>
